# StomEdit

StomEdit is a FAWE-like implementation of WorldEdit inside of Minestom.

**Warning! âš  This project has only been tested with `minestom-ce`. It may not work well with base Minestom.**

## Setup

```java
EventNode<Event> parentEventNode = ...; // you can use the global event node here if you want
StomEdit stomEdit = new StomEdit();

// enable everything
stomEdit.enable();

// or
stomEdit.bltoolEnable();
stomEdit.commandsEnable();
```

StomEdit is not available as an extension. Insert the code above after `MinestomServer.init();` and before starting the server.
